      <h2>1. GTO</h2>
      <br>
      <p><b>Genre: Comedy, School, Life Lessons</b></p>
      <p>GTO is the story of a guy called 𝙊𝙣𝙞𝙯𝙪𝙠𝙖 𝙀𝙞𝙠𝙞𝙘𝙝𝙞. Onizuka lives life exactly how he wants — loud, reckless, and unapologetically fun. In Japanese society, he’s the lowest of the low.
<br>
He’s the last person you’d expect to teach you anything valuable. He’s rude, crass, unprofessional, very perverted, embarrassing, and completely shameless. But hey, what else would you expect from a former gang leader?
<br>
Despite all that, Onizuka wants to become a teacher — not just any teacher, but the greatest teacher ever. He’s not great at teaching actual subjects, but when his students truly need him, he shows up. Every. Single. Time.
<br>
He’s assigned to the most notorious class in school — a group of psychological masterminds who destroy every teacher that dares try. But Onizuka? He’ll do whatever it takes to save his students, whether it's from others or from themselves.
<br>
What Onizuka really teaches is how to approach life. School shouldn’t be torture — it should be an adventure. Every day should be lived in the moment.
<br>
Onizuka feels like a superhero, but not the kind you could never be. He makes life feel worth it, even with all the chaos.
He doesn’t just feel like a character — he feels like a friend.</p>
